  "summary": "Implemented a frontend deployment failure banner with Retry/Dismiss controls and a new `useRetryableDeployment` hook that tracks status and attempts, supports manual retry, and shows a toast when no previous attempt exists. However, the manual retry does not appear to re-run the most recently saved attempt parameters/state; the saved attempt data is not used to drive the retry.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-36",
      "requirement": "Clicking the retry control re-runs the same deployment attempt (using the most recently saved attempt parameters/state) rather than doing nothing.",
      "reason": "The hook saves a deployment attempt (timestamp/options), but the `retry()` path only checks that an attempt exists and then runs `performDeployment` without using any saved parameters/state from `lastAttempt`.",

      "description": "Mock/randomized deployment behavior (simulated failures via Math.random and setTimeout) embedded in the retry/deploy hook.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on making retry UI/state reliable; it does not request introducing randomized mock deployment logic within the app code.",
